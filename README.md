## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm `Dr` and I am a student from HuBei, China with a passion for coding and technology. Currently, I am honing my skills in Java(Kotlin/JavaScript), C#, PHP, HTML,  and C++ and have a keen interest in back-end operations. 
A complete full-stack developer, with projects already in the pipeline.  Also have all sorts of weird interests.
I want to develop interesting projects with you! New challenges and opportunities to learn and grow!
